Last commit due 29th November 2019.<br>
The module is taught to students at GMIT. The lecturer is Ian McLoughlin.https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/




## 1. Introduction

## 2. A summary of the data set - what is it? why is it important?

## 3. Instructions for downloading this repository
Log on to GitHub and search for user ClodaghMurphy, the repository is entitled project-2019-fundda.<br>
On github.com choose the "Clone or download" button to copy the code onto your machine.<br>
For further information on how github works video guides are available here https://www.youtube.com/githubguides<br>

## 4. How to run the jupyter notebook used to investigate the data set 
Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project. The name, Jupyter, comes from the programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R.<br>
It is an open source web application used to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and text.<br>
The Jupyter Notebook is a useful tool to learn Python language and also enables sharing of data and images in a very accessible way.<br>
In order to install: On the command line, $ pip install jupyter<br>
After intall, on terminal, type the command: $ jupyter notebook<br>
Jupyter will initialise in the background and your default browser will pop up in a new tab connecting to webserver.<br> http://localhost:8888/tree<br>
The terminal will simultaneously display instructions on how to stop the connection to that webserver in addition to URL details that <br>contain a unique token.<br>
http://localhost:8888/?token=XXXXXYYYYY123456789<br>
Chrome and firefox are the optimal web browsers to use and you may need to copy the url into one of these instead of using the default<br> pop-up.<br>
You are running the Jupyter server and can use it to open and engage with my repository contents.<br>


## 5. What the Python Code does


Python Code File Name | Description
------------ | -------------
1Analysis  | Loads a segment of hardcoded data into a dataframe
2Analysis | Reads a text file into a dataframe
