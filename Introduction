What are tips?
A gratuity (also called a tip) is a sum of money customarily given by a client or 
customer to certain service sector workers for the service they have performed, in addition to the basic price of the service


According to https://www.tripadvisor.ie 
There is not a strong tipping culture in Ireland but many locals and visitors tend to tip for certain services, 
in particular restaurants, taxis and personal services (e.g. hairdressing). 
If you want to tip and are in doubt about how much, think 10%. All tips are at your discretion!

In April of this year,an Irish Times article explored the phenomenon of business owners taking the "tips" left by customers
and using these funds to pay wages, rather than distributing them amongst staff as a bonus.
